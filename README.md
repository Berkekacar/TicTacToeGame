# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX) game developed using SwiftUI. The game involves two players taking turns to place X or O marks on a 3x3 grid, trying to be the first to get three in a row, column, or diagonal.

# Features

Two-Player Mode: The game is played between two players taking alternate turns.
Simple and User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be straightforward and easy to use.
Winner Detection: The game automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game ends in a draw.
Game Reset: Players can reset the game and start over after it ends.
How to Play

Start the game and take turns placing X and O marks.
The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
